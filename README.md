# LawLargeNumbers

This script demonstrate large numbers law

Roughly speaking, the law of large numbers says that the more attempts we make, the more the result will tend towards the average.

For example, consider a coin.
We take n participants and give each m attempts to throw a coin.
At infinity, everyone should throw away the n / 2 tails and the deviation from the expected result should be 0%
